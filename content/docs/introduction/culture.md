Getting involved in impactful projects can help pave the way to success and making sure that you are involved in the future. Get involved in planning meetings, proposals, design decisions, and projects in which you can eventually provide your expertise to meaningfully contribute.

- Adopting a new technology
- Improvements to the software development lifecycle
- Reducing wasteful resources

In which projects should have clear ownership and expectations for a given task. The same should be true across your environment including your infrastructure components, applications, projects, and associated assets.

Giving engineers freedom and ownership of their given function with the right resources will go a long way in ensuring security is a part of the product.
